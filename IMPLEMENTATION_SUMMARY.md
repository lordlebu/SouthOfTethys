# South of Tethys Book Publish Implementation Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION

I have successfully implemented the complete "Book Publish" workflow for the South of Tethys repository as requested in the problem statement.

### 🎯 Requirements Met

**✅ Branch Creation**
- Created "book-publish" branch (note: git required "book-publish" instead of "Book Publish" due to naming conventions)

**✅ CI/CD Workflow Enhancement**
- Enhanced `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with comprehensive artifact generation
- Added support for multiple branch triggers (main, feature/*, book-publish)
- Implemented manual publication triggers via `workflow_dispatch`
- Added proper GitHub Pages deployment configuration

**✅ Artifact Generation**
- Timeline summaries (`timeline_summary.md`)
- Mermaid diagrams (`timeline_mermaid.md`) 
- Interactive maps (`interactive_map.html`)
- Timeline graphs and data (`timeline.json`)
- Overworld maps (`overworld.json`, `regions.geojson`)

**✅ GitHub Pages Deployment**
- Created proper docs/ directory structure
- Configured `docs/index.md` and `docs/timeline_mermaid.md` for public viewing
- Added `_config.yml` for proper GitHub Pages configuration
- Set up automatic docs generation and deployment

**✅ Documentation**
- Created comprehensive `docs/PUBLISHING.md` with complete workflow instructions
- Updated main `README.md` with book publishing information and quick links
- Enhanced `CONTEXT.md` with artifact and publishing details
- Added clear instructions for manual publication triggers

**✅ Infrastructure Improvements**
- Fixed map generation by adding `folium` dependency and creating valid GeoJSON
- Updated Dockerfile to include all necessary project files
- Fixed `.dockerignore` to properly include required files
- Added comprehensive `.gitignore` for clean repository management

### 🚀 Key Features Implemented

**Automatic Publishing Pipeline:**
```yaml
# Triggers on:
- Push to main branch (full publication)
- Push to book-publish branch (full publication)
- Push to feature/* branches (artifact generation)
- Pull requests (validation and review)
- Manual triggers via GitHub Actions
```

**Generated Artifacts:**
- 📊 Timeline visualizations (text + Mermaid diagrams)
- 🗺️ Interactive geographic maps with clickable regions
- 📁 Complete JSON data exports
- 📚 GitHub Pages documentation site
- 🔍 All artifacts available as downloadable files

**Publishing Workflow:**
1. **Validation:** Story consistency checking with `lint_story.py`
2. **Generation:** Timeline, map, and data artifact creation
3. **Upload:** Artifacts published as GitHub Actions artifacts
4. **Deployment:** Automatic GitHub Pages deployment for public access

### 📖 How to Use

**For Contributors:**
1. Make changes to world data (timeline, characters, locations)
2. Test locally: `python utils/lint_story.py`
3. Commit and push to trigger automatic publication

**For Manual Publishing:**
1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Select "CI" workflow 
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enable "Publish complete book artifacts"
5. Published content available at: `https://lordlebu.github.io/SouthOfTethys/`

**For Accessing Published Content:**
- **Main Timeline:** https://lordlebu.github.io/SouthOfTethys/
- **Visual Timeline:** https://lordlebu.github.io/SouthOfTethys/timeline_mermaid.html
- **Interactive Map:** https://lordlebu.github.io/SouthOfTethys/interactive_map.html

### 🧪 Testing Completed

**✅ Script Validation:**
- All Python scripts tested and working (`lint_story.py`, `generate_timeline_mermaid.py`, `generate_map.py`)
- Artifact generation verified locally
- Dependencies properly configured

**✅ Workflow Simulation:**
- Complete CI/CD workflow steps tested locally
- All artifacts generated successfully
- Documentation structure verified

**✅ File Structure:**
```

```

### 🔧 Technical Details

**Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline:**
- Multi-job workflow with proper dependencies
- Artifact uploading for all generated content
- GitHub Pages deployment with proper permissions
- Error handling and validation steps

**Fixed Dependencies:**
- Added `folium` to requirements.txt for map generation
- Created valid GeoJSON structure for geographic data
- Proper Docker configuration for containerized builds

**Documentation System:**
- Comprehensive publishing workflow guide
- Clear instructions for both automatic and manual publication
- Updated project documentation with publishing information

## 🎉 Result

The South of Tethys repository now has a complete "Book Publish" workflow that automatically generates and publishes comprehensive world artifacts including interactive timelines, geographic maps, and structured data. Contributors can easily publish updates through normal git workflows, and maintainers can trigger manual publications as needed.

The implementation meets all requirements specified in the problem statement and provides a robust, automated publishing system for the collaborative storytelling engine.

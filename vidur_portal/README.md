# Vidur Portal

An independent web application for story snippet processing and worldbuilding, powered by Hugging Face AI.

## About the Name
Vidur is a wise seer from Indian mythology, renowned for his remote vision and insight. The Norse deity Mimir, similarly, is famed for his wisdom and ability to see beyond the presentâ€”his head was consulted for advice after his death, and he guarded the Well of Wisdom. Both figures symbolize deep knowledge and remote perception, making "Vidur Portal" a fitting name for a tool that extracts hidden structure from stories.

## Features
- Paste or upload story snippets
- AI-powered extraction of character and event data using our Hugging Face model (`lordlebu/4000BCSaraswaty`)
- Modular, standalone architecture
- Can be integrated with SouthOfTethys or used independently

## Getting Started
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the app: `streamlit run app.py`

## Model Management & Integration Strategy

- The Vidur Portal uses the Hugging Face model (`lordlebu/4000BCSaraswaty`) for extracting structured data from story snippets.
- Model pushes and updates are performed manually/local only; CI/CD does not push models or expose credentials.
- Always validate your model locally before pushing to Hugging Face (see `utils/test_hf_push.py` in the main repo).
- The portal is designed to be modular and can be integrated with SouthOfTethys or used independently for worldbuilding tasks.

## Trivia
- **Mimir (Norse):** Keeper of the Well of Wisdom, advisor to gods, his severed head continued to offer counsel.
- **Vidur (Indian):** Sage and advisor in the Mahabharata, famed for his impartiality and foresight.
